    "Liver cancer has the second highest worldwide cancer mortality rate and has limited therapeutic options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common form of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), making up 80% of liver cancer cases in the US. HCC is the 9th leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, and third worldwide.[1](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga/studied-cancers/liver)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A consortium known as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) network has made a plethora of molecular information on various cancers, including HCC publicly available. This data include genetic, molecular, diagnostic, demographic, and clinical information from over 350 patients with HCC. \n",
    "\n",
    "While surgery can be an effective method for treating early-stage liver cancer, there are few options for more advanced and metastatic tumors. Sorafenib and regorafinib are the only approved treatments for managing advanced HCC, and many others potential therapeutics have failed in Phase III clinical trials. [Previous studies](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30639-6) studying genomic alterations in samples have found frequently-mutated genes LZTR1, EEF1A1, SF3B1, and SMARCA4.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to DNA alterations however, different biological and tumor microenvrionment factors can influence disease progression. A transcriptomic survey of tissues at various stages of disease progression could help elucidate some of the underlying pathways contributing to tumorigenesis."
