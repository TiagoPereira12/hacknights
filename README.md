# New York Health Artificial Intelligence Society Hack Nights

## The Cancer Genome Atlas Series
This series explores a publicly-available liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma/LIHC) dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlast (TCGA) project. You can follow the notebooks from the 3-part workshop to learn how to work with gene expression data, as well as see how researchers are able to use this data to discover biomarkers and pathways important to cancer genomics.

The series is broken into 3 parts:
- Exploratory data analysis of RNA-seq data
- Dimension reduction and modeling
- Parameter optimization and visualization of findings

You should install the libraries in requirements.txt for use.

## Using this repo on Spell.ml
In order to get up and running in the short amount of time at hacknight events, we recommend that you use a web-based console to run Jupyter, such as Spell.ml. You can sign up for a Spell community account [here](https://web.spell.run/register).

#### Setup
1. Initialize with Github Repo: [https://github.com/nyhais/hacknights](https://github.com/nyhais/hacknights)
2. Requirements: Paste in the requirements in the requirements.txt file
3. Start Server/Workspace
4. Use the .ipynb notebook files in tcga-series/workshop[#]
